# Pubnub C-core for the Windows platform

This is the part of C-core for the Windows platform.
It has the (Windows) platform-specific files and a
sample Makefile (`windows.mk`), which will build
sample programs:

- `pubnub_sync_sample.exe`: a "walk-through" of the "sync" interface (API)
- `pubnub_callback_sample.exe`: a "walk-through" of the "callback"
	interface (API)
- `cancel_subscribe_sync_sample.exe`: an example how to cancel a subscribe
  loop safely, using the "sync" interface
- `subscribe_publish_callback_sample.exe`: an example of how to have one
  outstanding publish and one outstanding subscribe transaction/operation
  at the same time, using the "callback" interface.

The sources of the samples are in `../core/samples`,
as they are portable across all or most hosted platforms
(POSIX, Windows...).

So, to build the samples, just run:

	nmake windows.mk
	
from a Visual Studio Command Prompt. This was tested mainly
on MSVS 2010 and Windows 7 & 8, but should work with pretty
much any MSVS since 2005 and Windows since XP.

There are no special requirements for C-core on
Windows, except for a working compiler and Windows SDK - and
having Windows XP or newer.

If you have Clang for Windows installed, this should work:

    nmake -f windows.mk CC=clang-cl
    
There is a Makefile for a `gcc` compatible compiler - `windows-gcc.mk`.
So, if you have MINGW, this should work:

    mingw32-make -f windows-gcc.mk

## Makefile remarks

The Makefile is designed to be minimal and illustrate what modules you
need and what `#define`s and compiler/link options, to build
C-core. It is _not_ designed to be just copy-pasted into a production
Makefile, because that is pretty much impossible - there are way too
many ways to "make a Makefile", we can't cover them all.
